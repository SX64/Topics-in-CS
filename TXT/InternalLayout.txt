Game Internal Layout Proposal

Major Classes

Map
	made up of 4 boards

Board
	made up of locations and connections between them
	
Location
	has armies
	has castles
	has tokens

Card
	Has type
	Has ID
	Has Long Term effects
	Has turn effects

Player
	Has Cards
	Has unplayed armies
	Has coins

Game cycles through players, each doing a turn
Can have type AI Player

Graphics entirely separate from Game
EX:
	select location called by graphics input, or called by AI player.
	It has no innate graphics

Model-View-Controller scheme seems appropriate

python's single pass file read my introduce complications if not accounted for
